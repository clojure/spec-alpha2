alpha.spec
========================================

spec is a Clojure library to describe the structure of data and functions. Specs can be used to validate data, conform (destructure) data, explain invalid data, generate examples that conform to the specs, and automatically use generative testing to test functions.

For more information:

* Rationale - https://clojure.org/about/spec
* Guide - https://clojure.org/guides/spec (for spec.alpha, note namespaces and other differences below)

spec.alpha was released with Clojure 1.9 and can be found at https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha. This library is an evolution from spec.alpha as well as work towards several new features. Please note that alpha.spec is not 100% API-compatible with spec.alpha (although it is similar).

Namespaces to load:

    (require '[clojure.alpha.spec :as s]
             '[clojure.alpha.spec.gen :as gen]
             '[clojure.alpha.spec.test :as test])

Releases and Dependency Information
========================================

This library is a work in progress provided to gather feedback during development. Namespaces, apis, etc may change without warning. The HEAD may not always be stable (although it usually is).

During development, you can use the git dep to try alpha.spec:

    clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.1"}
                        org.clojure/test.check {:mvn/version "0.9.0"} 
                        org.clojure/alpha.spec {:git/url "https://github.com/clojure/spec-alpha2.git" 
                                                :sha "<SHA>"}}}'

Where the latest SHA can be found with:

    git ls-remote https://github.com/clojure/spec-alpha2.git refs/heads/master

When we believe this library is ready for use, we will begin publishing releases to Maven central.
